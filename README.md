# project title: Secure-AES Encryption and Decryption GUI Tool


Key Features:

User-Friendly GUI: The application features an intuitive graphical user interface that simplifies the encryption and decryption process.

Binary Input: The tool accepts binary input for both plaintext and encryption keys, ensuring compatibility with the S-AES algorithm's requirements.

Automatic Key Generation: The tool automatically generates the round keys (w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5) based on the provided encryption key.

Encryption: Users can input plaintext and encryption keys, and the tool performs the S-AES encryption, displaying the step-by-step results, including round keys, intermediate calculations, and the final ciphertext.

Decryption: The tool also supports decryption. Users can input the ciphertext and the same encryption key used for encryption to retrieve the original plaintext.

Detailed Insights: Each step of the encryption and decryption process is displayed, helping users understand the inner workings of the S-AES algorithm.

Error Handling: The tool provides error handling and validation to ensure that input data meets the S-AES requirements.
